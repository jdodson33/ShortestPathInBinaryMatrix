# ShortestPathInBinaryMatrix
Two solutions to LeetCode question - Shortest Path in Binary Matrix

The first solution is more of a bruteforce solution using recursion. This method fails at larger matrix sizes

The second solution is an optimized BFS that uses a queue for prioritization (also no recursion)
